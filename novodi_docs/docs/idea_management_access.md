# Idea Management Access

## Getting Access to Idea Management

The Novodi idea management is currently in an early adapter phase. Getting access requires an organisation. Write an email to hello@novodi.app to apply for an early adapter organisation.

Existing organisations can be accessed in three different ways:

1. Log in with your account on [novodi.app](https://novodi.app/en/home) and select your organisation from the dropdown on the top right.

2. Go directly to your organisation by entering your organisation-id before in the link *organisation-id*.novodi.app

3. Ask the [Owner](/idea_management_roles/#owner)
