# Idea List Kiosk Mode
The Idea List Kiosk Mode allows you to show all the submitted ideas on a kiosk screen. This can be interesting for example during an idea generation event where users add ideas using the [QR Code method](/idea_management_ideas/#qr-code-idea-submission). 

In Kiosk Mode, the Idea List will refresh every 10 seconds so that newly submitted ideas are immediately visible.

## How to enter Kiosk Mode
The Kiosk Mode is entered by navigating to the idea list, and adding the following to the end of the url: `?kiosk=true`.
The full url will be: `https://organization-slug.novodi.app/en/ideas/list?kiosk=true`. Make sure to replace `organizaton-slug` with your own organization slug.
