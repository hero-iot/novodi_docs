# Organization administration
Administration of the organization is done via Settings. Here, everything about the tenant can be configured.

#### Owner
The owner of the organization has all the permissions within the tenant without explicitly assigning them. When a new organization is created, the owner can invite other users and assign roles to other users.

#### Associated domains
Domain names can be associated with the organization to allow users that have an email address on that domain to access the organization. This way, any user in your company sign up to Novodi and access the organization without explicitly inviting them. An organization can have multiple associated domains. Contact customer support to add or remove associated domains.
