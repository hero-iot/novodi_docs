# Organization administration
Administration of the organization is done via Settings. Here, everything about the tenant can be configured.

## General
In the general tab, you can view and edit your own user account, as well as the organization details.

#### Owner
The owner of the organization has all the permissions within the tenant without explicitly assigning them. When a new organization is created, the owner can invite other users and assign roles to other users.

#### Associated domains
Domain names can be associated with the organization to allow users that have an email address on that domain to access the organization. This way, any user in your company sign up to Novodi and access the organization without explicitly inviting them. An organization can have multiple associated domains. Contact customer support to add or remove associated domains.



## Members
Manage the users that are part of the organization here. 

### Invite a user
To invite a new user, click the 'Invite user' button in the top right. Be aware that you need to have the 'User Manager' role in order to do so. A window will pop up where you can enter the email address of the user you would like to invite. If the user already has an account with Novodi, the user will be directly added to the organization. If the user does not have an account yet, it will receive an invitation email. After signing up, the user will have access to the organization.

### Assign user roles
To manage user roles, click the key button in the row of the user. Be aware that you need to have the 'User Manager' role to be able to manage user roles. After clicking the button, a window will pop up where you can use the drop down button to select the roles that the user should have. Remove a role by clicking the X. Hit Save to apply the changes. Hit Cancel to discard changes.

### Remove a user from the tenant
To remove a user from the organization, click the trash can icon.
