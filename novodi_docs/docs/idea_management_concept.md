## Effort vs Impact

The essence of idea management is to minimize effort while maximazing positive impact or upside for the organization by collecting, evaluating and implementing new ideas.

Any [Idea](idea_management_ideas.md) which comes up in an organization has an unknown upside which makes it difficult to allocate time and money to investigate the potential upside or even implement the idea as a project. Regardless, any idea should be further evaluted to make sure that a significant upside is not lost for the organization.

Implementing a project requires a lot of effort and therefore the upside and costs of an idea as project should be very clear.

This is where (project) [Sketches](idea_management_sketches.md) come in as a stage which requires only a little effort but gives a good enough estimate of the costs and upside of a possible project based on the initial idea.

With this degree of certainty and in comparison to other project sketches, an organization can prioritize, schedule and implement [Projects](idea_management_projects.md).

With the project advancing, changes to costs and upside can be tracked and used to not only re-evaluate prioritization but especially to improve the skill of a team or organization to collect ideas at scale, derive a strategy from project sketches and efficiently implement projects - this empowers the team or organization to own their own innovation and (digital) transformation.
